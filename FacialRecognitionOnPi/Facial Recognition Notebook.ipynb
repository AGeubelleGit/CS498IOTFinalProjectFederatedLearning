Tracing is expensive and the excessive number of tracings could be due to (1) creating @tf.function repeatedly in a loop, (2) passing tensors with different shapes, (3) passing Python objects instead of tensors. For (1), please define your @tf.function outside of the loop. For (2), @tf.function has experimental_relax_shapes=True option that relaxes argument shapes that can avoid unnecessary retracing. For (3), please refer to https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/customization/performance#python_or_tensor_args and https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/function for  more details.\n",">loaded 4 examples for class: gary\n","(29, 160, 160, 3) (29,)\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"collapsed":true,"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"aJ0vXZf8QkIx","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1607725242482,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":19140,"user":{"displayName":"Gary Braznichenko","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GjQyEVLLY1dcJVFUowRUJ2a55z7uqxP3QGeNitW=s64","userId":"14444613033992669636"}},"outputId":"69fc37b3-1318-495c-cf20-9591604c84dd"},"source":["# get the face embedding for one face\n","def get_embedding(model, face_pixels):\n","\t# scale pixel values\n","\tface_pixels = face_pixels.astype('float32')\n","\t# standardize pixel values across channels (global)\n","\tmean, std = face_pixels.mean(), face_pixels.std()\n","\tface_pixels = (face_pixels - mean) / std\n","\t# transform face into one sample\n","\tsamples = np.expand_dims(face_pixels, axis=0)\n","\t# make prediction to get embedding\n","\tyhat = model.predict(samples)\n","\treturn yhat[0]\n"," \n","# load the face dataset\n","data = np.load('5-celebrity-faces-dataset.npz')\n","trainX, trainy, testX, testy = data['arr_0'], data['arr_1'], data['arr_2'], data['arr_3']\n","print('Loaded: ', trainX.shape, trainy.shape, testX.shape, testy.shape)\n","# load the facenet model\n","model = load_model('facenet_keras.h5')\n","print('Loaded Model')\n","# convert each face in the train set to an embedding\n","newTrainX = list()\n","for face_pixels in trainX:\n","\tembedding = get_embedding(model, face_pixels)\n","\tnewTrainX.append(embedding)\n","newTrainX = np.asarray(newTrainX)\n","print(newTrainX.shape)\n","# convert each face in the test set to an embedding\n","newTestX = list()\n","for face_pixels in testX:\n","\tembedding = get_embedding(model, face_pixels)\n","\tnewTestX.append(embedding)\n","newTestX = np.asarray(newTestX)\n","print(newTestX.shape)\n","# save arrays to one file in compressed format\n","np.savez_compressed('5-celebrity-faces-embeddings.npz', newTrainX, trainy, newTestX, testy)"],"execution_count":9,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Loaded:  (102, 160, 160, 3) (102,) (29, 160, 160, 3) (29,)\n","WARNING:tensorflow:No training configuration found in the save file, so the model was *not* compiled.
